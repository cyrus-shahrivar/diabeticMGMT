# Diabetic Management Application Prototyping

Author: Cyrus Shahrivar
Date: 4/5/2016

## Outline of Concept
- Include forms to allow for input of vitals
- Graph vitals after hitting update button
- Hit USDA API to show food information
  - It might be good to split the string up and search each meal component, or have form fill-in of each part of the meal, then do the search for nutrition information.
  - It might be good to have an easy way to adjust the amount of food had that isn't just form input, but maybe a "volume control" type of input

## To Do's
- Need to think about how to make the application better than a spreadsheet or paper log
- Need to strongly thing about user interaction and experience
